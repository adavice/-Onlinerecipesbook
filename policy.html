Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the Personal Data that are equivalent to those that apply in the EEA or in the country in which you live. In addition, if you use our Services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with these Services.
