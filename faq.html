                                    <p>When you want to view a recipe at OnlineRecipesbook.com you need to log in. Sign
                                        in with the registered e-mail address and password in the top right corner. If
                                        you need help remembering your password, simply click on "Forgot password" and
                                        we will send you an e-mail. If you don’t have a user, you can quickly create a
                                        profile. You merely have to submit name, e-mail address and pick a password.
                                        It's quick and simple. See an overview of all the recipes by clicking on
                                        'recipes' at the top of the page and click on the recipe you wish to view.

                                    <h4>I don’t know my password. How do I reset it?</h4>
                                    <p>If you signed up through one of our introductory offers, your password was
                                        automatically generated and sent to you by e-mail. If you created a membership
                                        on the OnlineRecipesbook.com, you picked your own password. In any case you can
                                        easily retrieve the password if you either forgot it or can't find the e-mail
                                        that was sent to you with login information. All you have to do is go to
                                        OnlineRecipesbook.com and click on "Log in" at the top right. You need to select
                                        "Forgot password" on the pop up and then enter the e-mail address that you
                                        signed up with. Once you have pressed confirm, you should receive your password
                                        in your inbox within a few minutes. If the e-mail fails to appear, please try
                                        checking your "spam folder" as they sometimes mistakenly end up there. Should
                                        the system report an error, try entering any other e-mail address you may have.
                                        Perhaps you accidentally signed up with an old e-mail address. If all fails,
                                        feel free to contact customer service.</p>

                                        OnlineRecipesbook.com. For instance, if you have an Outlook e-mail account
                                        (Hotmail, MSN, Live, etc.), you may experience problems. Check your spam filter
                                        to ensure that e-mails from OnlineRecipesbook.com are not accidentally ending up
                                        in this folder. Be sure to add the e-mail domain '@ OnlineRecipesbook.com' to

                                        receiving e-mails from OnlineRecipesbook.com, contact your ISP to find out
